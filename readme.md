# UNOFFICIAL FORK

Hi - I did not write the majority of this code.

This is mostly a copy from [here](https://github.com/mixer/amf0).

I have ported the code over and retained the original MIT license.

I will be making changes to make this code (and it's imports) compile.  

This comes with no service guarantee and you should never use this code, especially in production.
